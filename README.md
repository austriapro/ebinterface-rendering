#ebInterface Rendering

The goal of ebInterface rendering is to provide an API, allowing to transform a given ebInterface XML representation to a PDF document.

Using [ebInterface Web](https://github.com/austriapro/ebinterface-web) a user may easily upload a given ebInterface XML instance and transform it to a downloadable PDF document.
